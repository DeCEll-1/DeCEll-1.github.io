                    <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                        WH/FO Hauling is a type of hauling in wild space in which you find 2 FO's on opposite sides on
                        the galaxy such that they
                        have optimal or near optimal spice prices (check <a
                            href="https://starscape-roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Spice">wiki</a>
                        for a table on spice
                        prices).
                        <br><br>
                        Then, you get a wormhole that connects closely connects both of them, so that you don't
                        have to do too many warp jumps (&lt;5 or so jumps is good).
                        <br> <br>
                        Since FO's sell gemstone spice instead of regular spice,
                        this technique can make millions of credits extremely quickly, and is the best way to make
                        money (besides investing).

                    <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                        This is the hardest part of WH/FO hauling. FO's are fairly uncommon, and finding wormholes that
                        connect wild systems
                        exactly across from each other at the galaxy is even rarer.
                        <br><br>
                        However, there are a few tips that I
                        can give, that will
                        hopefully limit your time scouting (and maybe save your life).

                    <ul style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                        <hr>
                        <li>
                            <b>Look for a secure WH to enter wild.</b> <br><br>
                            Use wormholes to enter wild. whilst it may seem tempting to just warp to the wilds normally
                            (especially if you cant find
                            a wormhole to the wilds), there are 3 main reasons why you shouldn't. the first is that it
                            is simply quite dangerous to
                            warp the wilds, especially when you are at the outer unsecure systems and inner wilds.
                            pirates, whilst rare, are still a
                            threat that you should remember. reason two is that it can be quite tedious and slow to go
                            from citadel, into the wilds,
                            find a route, and then go all the way back, get a hauler, go all the way back again, haul,
                            and do another trip back to
                            the galaxy. it is way faster to simply use a wormhole and effectively skip all the
                            travelling involved. reason three is
                            that wormholes provide an easy gateway for smaller trips, and also can be used for other
                            expeditions (such as mining and
                            pve expeditions). additionally, wormholes are one of the safest places to be in wilds, since
                            they grant invincibility as
                            soon as you enter them, even if your ship is not inside the wormhole. this makes them
                            invaluable for wild campers.

                                    seen in
                                    the

                                    drawing a straight line
                                    from the borders of each spice region into wilds gives a decent image of what colour
                                    spice
                                    that system has. Just
                                    remember, that the borders are not as simple as this, so FOs you find may actually
                                    be a
                                    different spice than what you
                                    may expect. Keep track of any FO's you come across whilst looking for a suitable WH.

                                make sure to check every system 1 warp away, then 2, and so on from a potential route.
                                when your scouting, you may run
                                into a wormhole that seems optimal, but can't find any FOs nearby. this occurs fairly
                                commonly, and can be quite
                                annoying. however, an easy way to counteract it is to check every system 1 warp away
                                from the wormhole, then 2, and so
                                on until you find an FO. this prevents the route from being overly long, as has the
                                added benefit of allowing you to
                                cherrypick routes of certain lengths.

                                LOG YOUR FINDINGS. i know, i know. it can be annoying to have to find an anomaly, and
                                then write it down, but it makes
                                your life (and the lives of others using your route) so much easier. now, not every
                                anomaly is worth logging, of course.
                                Personally, besides wormholes and FO's (which you should be logging), the only other
                                worthwhile anomalies to log are VX
                                and AN anomalies, which can yield a lot of money. Other anomalies, such as MTs and ALs,
                                whilst profitable, are too
                                common to be worth going into wilds for.

                    <p style="font-size: xx-large;">Part 3 - what do i do after i find a route?</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: x-large;">
                        Here comes the money-making part. After finding a
                        route, use the best
                        hauler you have. As a
                        general rule of thumb, ships
                        with more cargo storage are better, but some ships can be situationally better than others. For
                        example, a shroud may be
                        better than a galaxy if you are doing it with no or 1 alt, and have 2 warp amplifiers. Once you
                        arrive at the first FO,
                        buy the cargo and head to the Wh to get the second one. After this, continue selling and buying
                        from both FO's. You may
                        notice that prices start to rise after a while - but do not fret. If your WH is in an optimal
                        spice spot, you will
                        always make atleast 400 credits per cargo at maximum exhaustion. Don't forget your commerce
                        skill tree - maxing out
                        cargo on the commerce skill tree allows you to make almost twice the profit.</p>

                            ok basically u want to use either a <u>shroud</u> or <u>galaxy</u>, as these are the two
                            best
                            hauling ships (if you dont have
                            these/cant afford them i'll say what else is alright). anyway, I see a lot of people asking
                            which they should use, and
                            how this affects rates. BASICALLY, a shroud with double warp amplifier is slightly better
                            than galaxy, provided that you
                            leave little to no gaps between warps, which when hauling with a single account is easy.
                            also, the shroud is
                            significantly faster than the galaxy, which is good for getting to cargo stations on FO's
                            faster and for entering
                            wormholes. however, if you are either A. on a route longer than 4 warps or B. multiboxing
                            (hauling on multiple accounts
                            at once), then you should basically always use galaxy. the shroud's benefits mean nothing if
                            each account may be waiting
                            between each warp, which is very prevalent in multiboxing (especially when it's over 3-4
                            accounts).

                            now, what if your POOR and cant afford either? well, welcome to the zubron. the zubron is
                            like one fifth the price of
                            the shroud and galaxy, yet it functions almost as well as them. plop 2 warp amplifiers on
                            it, and it can actually
                            outperform the galaxy (sometimes). astero and veil, the two other intermediate haulers, are
                            fine, but are just not as
                            good as the zubron in speed or hauling capacity.

                            but what if your B R O K E and cant even afford a corvette hauler? well, don't fret, since
                            you can use a bison (use this
                            over the rhino, just trust me on this). however, do note that if your hauling on a
                            semi-decent hauling route, that you
                            should basically switch to a zubron as soon as you hit 40k or so, since the bison is still
                            painfully slow.

                            Optimal - the most asked one is most definitely "what does 'optimal' mean?". For a route to
                            be "optimal", it must go
                            from an FO on one side of the galaxy, and head to an FO on the exact opposite side. In the
                            star menu, you can turn on
                            spice colouring, which shows the six types of spice - blue, yellow, orange, pink, red, and
                            green. As you can see, they
                            are split evenly among the galaxy, with there being 3 on each side. A route that is optimal
                            will go from a spice sector
                            to the spice sector on the other side. for example, an optimal route with a blue FO will
                            connect to an FO on the other
                            side, with pink spice.

                            'x' warp - This term refers to how many system warps a route takes to haul once. for this,
                            you do not include warps
                            inside a system, such as warping to a wormhole or FO inside a system. The lower warp a
                            hauling route is, the faster it
                            is, with the best possible hauling route having 0 warps (no system warps whatsoever).

                        <li>
                            Stable, transient, and decaying - these terms refer to how long a wormhole has left until it
                            collapses. These are fairly
                            self explanatory - the majority of wormholes spawn as transient, meaning that they collapse
                            within 48 hours of spawning.
                            Stable wormholes are rare wormholes that can last 2 weeks before collapsing, and are usually
                            very sought after for their
                            longevity. decaying wormholes are wormholes that have under 6 hours left. Note that a
                            wormhole can spawn as a stable or
                            transient wormhole, but NOT a decaying wormhole.
