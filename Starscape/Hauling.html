                    <p style="font-size: xx-large;">Part 1 - what's a wh/fo?</p>

                    <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                        WH/FO Hauling is a type of hauling in wild space in which you find 2 FO's on opposite sides on
                        the galaxy such that they
                        have optimal or near optimal spice prices (check https://starscape-roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Spice
                        for a table on spice
                        prices).
                        <br><br>
                        Then, you get a wormhole that connects closely connects both of them, so that you don't
                        have to do too many warp jumps (&lt;5 or so jumps is good).
                        <br> <br>
                        Since FO's sell gemstone spice instead of regular spice,
                        this technique can make millions of credits extremely quickly, and is the best way to make
                        money (besides investing).

                    <p style="font-size: xx-large;">Part 2 - how do i find a route?</p>

                    <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                        This is the hardest part of WH/FO hauling. FO's are fairly uncommon, and finding wormholes that
                        connect wild systems
                        exactly across from each other at the galaxy is even rarer.
                        <br><br>
                        However, there are a few tips that I
                        can give, that will
                        hopefully limit your time scouting (and maybe save your life).

                    <ul style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                        <hr>
                        <li>
                            <b>Look for a secure WH to enter wild.</b> <br><br>
                            Even though you can make the long route to the inner
                            wilds, it not only is extremely
                            dangerous (especially if your in a hauler ship), but it is also quite slow, and you may run
                            into players at the inner
                            wilds. Finding a secure WH is a lot faster, and can allow you to make trips to and from the
                            wh/fo route easily, making
                            it especially useful for galaxy haulers.

                            <div>

                                    Once in wild, look for a WH that leads to the opposite spice region. <br><br> As
                                    seen in
                                    the
                                    image
                                    at left,
                                    drawing a straight line
                                    from the borders of each spice region into wilds gives a decent image of what colour
                                    spice
                                    that system has. Just
                                    remember, that the borders are not as simple as this, so FOs you find may actually
                                    be a
                                    different spice than what you
                                    may expect. Keep track of any FO's you come across whilst looking for a suitable WH.

                                this will make routes that you
                                do find a lot shorter than
                                simply spurting into a random direction. This also allows you to cherrypick wh/fo routes
                                of
                                certain lengths, so that you
                                dont end up with unnecessarily long routes.

                                can lose both you and fellow users of your route a lot of money! Be cautious of who you
                                tell your routes to, and be sure
                                that they won't attempt to pirate you.

                    <p style="font-size: xx-large;">Part 3 - what do i do after i find a route?</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: x-large;">
                        Here comes the money-making part. After finding a
                        route, use the best
                        hauler you have. As a
                        general rule of thumb, ships
                        with more cargo storage are better, but some ships can be situationally better than others. For
                        example, a shroud may be
                        better than a galaxy if you are doing it with no or 1 alt, and have 2 warp amplifiers. Once you
                        arrive at the first FO,
                        buy the cargo and head to the Wh to get the second one. After this, continue selling and buying
                        from both FO's. You may
                        notice that prices start to rise after a while - but do not fret. If your WH is in an optimal
                        spice spot, you will
                        always make atleast 400 credits per cargo at maximum exhaustion. Don't forget your commerce
                        skill tree - maxing out
                        cargo on the commerce skill tree allows you to make almost twice the profit.</p>
